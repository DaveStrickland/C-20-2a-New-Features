# C++ 20 (2a) New Features
This is the code repository for [C++ 20 (2a) New Features [Video]](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/C-20-2a-New-Features), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
C++ is popular for its incredible performance and suitability for operating systems, games, embedded software, and more. This course gets you up-to-date with the very latest components in C++20/C++2a so you can harness its new enhancements and get ahead of the game by leveraging its features!
We cover what C++20/C++2a is and the current standardization status. We also discover some new syntactic sugars that enable you to write shorter but more powerful code. You'll learn about the new and improved ranges and iterators, explore key examples of filter stacking, and learn how ranges simplify iterator-heavy code. Crucially, you'll master how to migrate to C++20/C++2a in the easiest possible way, and why you should!
C++20/C++2a brings new features to the synchronization library, including atomic smart pointers, latchers, and barriers. We review its all-new coroutines (a major concept found in other leading programming languages that simplifies writing code for parallel execution).
By the end of the course, you'll use up-to-date insights into the full features of C++20/C++2a to facilitate efficient and fast coding within your own projects.
